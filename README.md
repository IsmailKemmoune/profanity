# Profanity

## Description

This library is targetting bad words and curses found in a text content. This library is targetting local languages or dialects.
As we know, there is an infinit dictionary of bad words and it might seem to be useless to counter that content, but with the help of contributers we can create the largest dataset that can be used in many open sourced projects and not only this one, the idea is to start simple then move forward with some more and more advanced to tackle different patterns, because a bad word can be written using words, numbers or signs; That makes it hard, but not impossible.

## Contribution

To contribute:

- If your language file dataset exists, you can create a new PR adding new possible bad words
- If your language is missing please submit an issue first, after that open a PR to create the new dataset for your local language
